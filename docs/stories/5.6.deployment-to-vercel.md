# Story 5.6: Deployment to Vercel

**Status:** In Progress

**Epic:** Epic 5: Polish, Testing & Deployment

---

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** the application deployed to a live URL,
**so that** evaluators can access the demo without local setup.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Vercel account created (or existing account used)
2. Project connected to GitHub repository
3. Environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` set (production key or development key)
4. Automatic deployment from main branch configured
5. Deployment successful (no build errors)
6. Live URL accessible and functional:
   - Home page loads
   - Problem input works
   - Tutoring session works end-to-end
   - Voice features work (if browser permissions allow)
7. SSL/HTTPS enabled (Vercel provides by default)
8. Custom domain configured (optional, nice-to-have)
9. Deployment URL documented in README.md
