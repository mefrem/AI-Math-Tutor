# Story 5.1: Comprehensive Problem Type Testing

**Status:** In Progress

**Epic:** Epic 5: Polish, Testing & Deployment

---

## Story

**As a** product manager,
**I want** to validate that the system successfully guides students through all target problem types using Socratic method,
**so that** I have confidence the solution delivers on the core value proposition.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Test Suite Defined:** 5 problem types with 2 examples each (10 total test problems):
   - **Arithmetic:** "What is 47 + 28?", "Calculate 144 ÷ 12"
   - **Fractions:** "What is 3/4 + 1/2?", "Simplify 6/8"
   - **Basic Algebra:** "Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 13", "If 3y - 7 = 11, what is y?"
   - **Word Problems:** "Sarah has 12 apples. She gives 1/3 to her friend. How many does she have left?", "A rectangle has length 8cm and width 5cm. What is its perimeter?"
   - **Multi-Step Problems:** "If a shirt costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?", "John ran 2.5 miles on Monday and 3.8 miles on Tuesday. How many total miles did he run?"

2. **Socratic Compliance Validation:**
   - Complete tutoring session for all 10 problems
   - Document each conversation (screenshots or text logs)
   - Verify: **Zero instances of tutor giving direct answers**
   - Verify: Tutor asks guiding questions, provides progressive hints
   - Verify: Tutor explicitly acknowledges incorrect answers
   - Verify: Tutor celebrates correct solutions

3. **Feature Utilization Check:**
   - Student drawing used in at least 3 test sessions
   - Tutor annotations (highlight/circle) used in at least 5 test sessions
   - Voice interaction used in at least 3 test sessions
   - All problem input methods tested (text, image upload, practice problem generation)

4. **Success Metrics:**
   - 100% Socratic compliance (no direct answers)
   - Average 6+ conversation turns per problem (indicates genuine guidance)
   - Session completion rate 80%+ (student reaches solution or reasonable stopping point)

5. **Documentation:** Test results documented with pass/fail for each problem and notes on tutoring quality

## Dev Notes

### Context from Previous Stories

This story focuses on comprehensive testing and validation of the entire system. It requires all features from previous epics to be functional:
- Socratic dialogue from Epic 1
- Problem input methods from Epic 2
- Whiteboard and annotations from Epic 3
- Voice interaction and avatar from Epic 4

### Testing Approach

This is primarily a validation/testing story rather than a development story. The work involves:
1. Executing test sessions
2. Documenting results
3. Validating compliance with requirements
4. Creating test reports

## Dev Agent Record

### Implementation Summary

**Developer:** James (via Orca Orchestrator)  
**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Status:** Test framework created, manual testing required

### Work Completed

1. **Test Documentation Created:**
   - Created test suite document: `docs/testing/test-suite-5.1.md`
   - Created test execution guide: `docs/testing/test-execution-guide.md`
   - Documented all 10 test problems with tracking structure

2. **Test Framework:**
   - Test suite includes all 5 problem types with 2 examples each
   - Each test case includes fields for:
     - Input method
     - Conversation log
     - Socratic compliance validation
     - Turn count
     - Feature utilization tracking
   - Summary statistics template included

3. **Execution Guide:**
   - Step-by-step testing procedure documented
   - Validation checklist created
   - Troubleshooting section included

### Implementation Notes

**Story Type:** Validation/Testing Story

This story requires manual test execution. The test framework and documentation have been created to support systematic testing. The actual test execution needs to be performed by:
1. Running the application
2. Executing each of the 10 test problems
3. Documenting results in the test suite document
4. Validating Socratic compliance and success metrics

**Next Steps:**
- Execute manual test sessions for all 10 problems
- Document results in `docs/testing/test-suite-5.1.md`
- Validate all acceptance criteria
- Create summary report

### Files Created/Modified

**New Files:**
- `docs/testing/test-suite-5.1.md` - Test suite with all 10 problems
- `docs/testing/test-execution-guide.md` - Testing procedure guide

**Modified Files:**
- `docs/stories/5.1.comprehensive-problem-type-testing.md` - This file

## Testing

### Test Framework Status

✅ Test suite documentation created  
✅ Test execution guide created  
⏳ Manual test execution pending

### Test Execution Plan

1. **Phase 1: Test Framework Setup** ✅ COMPLETE
   - Test suite document created
   - Test execution guide created
   - All test problems documented

2. **Phase 2: Manual Test Execution** ⏳ PENDING
   - Execute all 10 test problems
   - Document conversations
   - Validate Socratic compliance
   - Track feature utilization

3. **Phase 3: Results Analysis** ⏳ PENDING
   - Calculate success metrics
   - Create summary report
   - Validate all acceptance criteria

### Testing Notes

This story requires interactive manual testing as the acceptance criteria involve:
- Validating Socratic dialogue quality
- Testing real user interactions
- Observing tutor behavior across multiple problem types
- Documenting conversation quality

The test framework provides the structure for systematic testing and validation.
