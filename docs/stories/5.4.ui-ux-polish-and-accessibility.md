# Story 5.4: UI/UX Polish and Accessibility

**Status:** In Progress

**Epic:** Epic 5: Polish, Testing & Deployment

---

## Story

**As a** student,
**I want** a polished, intuitive interface that looks professional,
**so that** I feel confident using the tool and can navigate it easily.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Visual Polish:**
   - Consistent spacing, padding, alignment across all screens
   - Color palette applied consistently (primary blue, secondary green, accent orange)
   - Typography hierarchy clear (headings, body text, button labels)
   - Loading states are smooth and non-jarring
   - Animations (avatar, transitions) are polished, not glitchy

2. **User Experience Improvements:**
   - Button states clearly indicate interactivity (hover, active, disabled)
   - Focus states visible for keyboard navigation
   - Error messages are helpful and actionable ("Microphone access denied. Please check browser permissions.")
   - Success feedback is encouraging ("Great work! Let's try another problem.")
   - Clear calls-to-action ("Push to Talk", "Start Tutoring", "Restart Problem")

3. **Accessibility Basics:**
   - Keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements (tab, enter, space)
   - Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 minimum for text)
   - Alt text on images and icons
   - Text transcripts always visible alongside voice

4. **Responsive Design Validation:**
   - Test on 768px (tablet), 1024px, and 1440px+ (laptop) widths
   - Layout adapts without horizontal scrolling or cut-off content
   - Touch targets are appropriately sized for tablet use (44px minimum)

5. **User Testing (Optional but Recommended):**
   - Have 1-2 people (ideally in target age range or parents) try the system
   - Observe where they struggle or get confused
   - Make quick fixes to obvious UX issues
