# Story 5.5: Documentation Completion

**Status:** In Progress

**Epic:** Epic 5: Polish, Testing & Deployment

---

## Story

**As a** developer or evaluator,
**I want** comprehensive documentation that explains the project,
**so that** I can understand how to set it up, how it works, and the decisions made.

## Dev Notes

### Documentation Structure

- **README.md:** Main project documentation
- **docs/architecture/:** Architecture and design documentation
- **docs/testing/:** Testing documentation and results
- **docs/stories/:** User story documentation

### Key Design Decisions to Document

1. **Socratic Prompt Engineering:** Never provide direct answers, ask guiding questions
2. **Canvas Action Parsing:** 3-tier system (exact match, semantic match, fallback)
3. **Avatar Implementation:** 2D animated avatar with lip-sync
4. **Voice Interaction:** Push-to-talk model for student input
