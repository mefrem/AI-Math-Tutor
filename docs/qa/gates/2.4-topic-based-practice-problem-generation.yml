# NFR validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Topic input validation, API key server-side only, input validation in API route. Consider adding rate limiting and topic validation for injection attacks in future."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Fast topic validation, asynchronous problem generation with loading states, Suspense boundary prevents blocking. Bundle size: 5.5 KB for problem-input route."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling for all failure scenarios, topic validation prevents invalid topics, API error handling provides recovery options, graceful degradation (manual entry option)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean component structure, well-documented code, follows project conventions. Prompt properly located in prompts.ts file. Suspense boundary used correctly for Next.js 14."
