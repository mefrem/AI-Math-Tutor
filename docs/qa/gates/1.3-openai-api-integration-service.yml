nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "API key loaded from environment variables, never exposed to client. API route is server-side only. Service validates API key before initialization."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "API integration test passed successfully. Service uses appropriate GPT-4 Turbo model with reasonable token limits. Response time acceptable for LLM API."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling for all OpenAI API error types (401, 429, 400, 500/502/503). Network and timeout errors handled. Error responses follow standard format."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Service layer pattern followed correctly. API routes are thin controllers. TypeScript types properly defined and exported. Code follows coding standards."
