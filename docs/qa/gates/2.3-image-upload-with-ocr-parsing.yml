# NFR validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "File type validation (PNG, JPG, JPEG only), file size limits (5MB max), API key server-side only, input validation in API route. Consider adding rate limiting and file content validation in future."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Fast file validation, asynchronous base64 conversion, asynchronous OCR parsing with loading states. Bundle size: 4.68 KB for problem-input route."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling for all failure scenarios, file validation prevents invalid files, API error handling provides recovery options, graceful degradation (manual entry option)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean component structure, well-documented code, follows project conventions. OCR prompt properly located in prompts.ts file."
