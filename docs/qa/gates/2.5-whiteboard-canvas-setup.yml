    notes: "Canvas rendering component with no external data handling, file uploads, or API calls. Konva.js is a trusted library."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient rendering with Konva.js, ResizeObserver for efficient container tracking, proper cleanup prevents memory leaks. Bundle size: 95.7 KB for workspace route (includes Konva.js library, acceptable). Ready for 60fps performance validation."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper error handling, proper cleanup of resources (event listeners, ResizeObserver), minimum size constraints prevent layout issues, responsive sizing handles edge cases."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean component structure, well-documented code, follows project conventions. Proper use of React patterns (forwardRef, useImperativeHandle). TypeScript typing throughout."
