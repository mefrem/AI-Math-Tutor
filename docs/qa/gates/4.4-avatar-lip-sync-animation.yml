# NFR validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Audio context is a simple state management component with no external data handling, file uploads, or API calls. No security concerns."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Timer-based animation runs smoothly at 60fps. Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks. Audio context is lightweight and efficient. Natural lip-sync timing (150ms intervals) feels natural."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper cleanup of timer on unmount or audio end prevents memory leaks. Audio context properly synchronized with audio playback. Animation stops correctly when audio ends or pauses."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean component structure, well-documented code, follows project conventions. Proper use of React patterns (useContext, useEffect, useRef). TypeScript typing throughout. Clear separation of concerns (context, component, integration)."
