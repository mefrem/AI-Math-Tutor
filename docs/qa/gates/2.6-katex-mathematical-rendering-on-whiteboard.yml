# NFR validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "KaTeX and html2canvas are trusted libraries. No external data handling. Proper cleanup of temporary DOM elements. Error handling doesn't expose sensitive information."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Asynchronous rendering with loading states. Image caching to avoid re-rendering. Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks. Rendering doesn't block UI. Font size appropriate (24px) for readability. html2canvas conversion may be slower for complex expressions, but acceptable for MVP."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation. Fallback to plain text if KaTeX rendering fails. Proper cleanup of resources (temporary DOM elements). Semantic registry properly manages state."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean component structure, well-documented code, follows project conventions. Proper separation of concerns (rendering service, registry service, component). TypeScript typing throughout."
