nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "API service never exposes API key to client (server-side only). API calls made to Next.js API route (same domain). No sensitive data exposed in client-side code."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Zustand store uses selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Container/presentational pattern separates concerns efficiently. No performance issues identified."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Components properly typed with TypeScript. Error handling implemented in API service. Loading state managed correctly. Conversation history persists in Zustand store."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Components follow container/presentational pattern per coding standards. Zustand store uses selectors for performance. Code is well-structured and maintainable."
