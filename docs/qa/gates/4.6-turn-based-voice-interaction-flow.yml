# NFR validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Turn-based flow is a UI state management feature with no external data handling, file uploads, or API calls. No security concerns."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Turn-based flow uses existing state management (TutoringStore, AudioContext) efficiently. No performance concerns. State transitions are immediate."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Turn-based flow properly synchronized with loading state and audio playback. Button correctly disabled/enabled based on tutor state. Clear state transitions prevent confusion."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean component structure, well-documented code, follows project conventions. Proper use of React patterns (useContext, useState). TypeScript typing throughout. Clear separation of concerns."
